Welcome to **TATOE**, a web application for organising and participating in art trails.


<h2 class="acronym-highlight">Who I am</h2>

I'm Steve Lympany, and I live in the south east of England. I'm a retired engineer and now doing a bit of art. I also write software as a hobby. I wrote TATOE to help my local art club. I don't expect to make tons of dosh from it, but I would like to cover my web hosting costs. There is a Ko-fi button floating around on this page somewhere - "buy me a coffee" (shown as lympany.art - my other website). I hope your donations help cover my hosting/database costs.

<h2 class="acronym-highlight">Status</h2>

As of July 2025, TATOE is a prototype developed soley with my own ideas (but with a bit of experience in participating in art trails myself), so I'm sure there are plenty of features that could be added. Suggestions welcomed. Hopefully there aren't too many glitches. Please use the **contact form** below. I need some guinea pigs to test it!

<h2 class="acronym-highlight">What is TATOE?</h2>

TATOE is a pair of web applications designed for art trail management. 

<h3 class="acronym-highlight">(A) For the organisers (the owner and admins)</h3>

The **owner** creates the Art Trail project, with nothing more than the name. Then he/she creates an **admin**, with a username and password for the project. There can be more than one admin in an Art Trail. He can remove them admins at any time. The owner can have more than one Art Trail: He can delete them and pause them.

The **admin** also uses this app. He sets the trail dates, creates all the exhibitor sign-in credentials - easily done from a CSV file (from Excel). The admin can see the status of the art trail - who's going where, who has not been invited, who is registered etc. He can export a detailed summary that could then be emailed to others who are not using TATOE.

Admin also exports data that can be use for input/organising brochures and leaflets.

<h3 class="acronym-highlight">(B) For the exhibitors/participants</h3>
**Admin** will give you a **username**, and **password**, and also the **name of the Art Trail** to log in with. First, if you choose to participate in the event, press "register" at the top of your dashboard. If you want to be a **venue lead**, press the button for that, and enter the number of spots you have for other artists (you are a **guest** if you are not a venue lead). Then you can go ahead and start inviting, accepting, declining and revoking!

It's all live - when admin, guest or venue lead makes a change, all users who are logged in will see the change. TATOE is very fluid, people can change their minds at any time - later decide you don't want to be a venue lead, or change the number of guest spots at your venue, and even "unregister" to leave the project. The art trail project gets locked down by admin at the deadline... which he chooses.

<h2 class="acronym-highlight">Getting started</h2>

First, as the potential owner, you will need to contact me for a password. Art Trail **exhibitors and admins do not need a password** from me:; the owner will give a password for the admins, the admins give passwords to the artists exhibiting.
