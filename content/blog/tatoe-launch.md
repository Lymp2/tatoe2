I'm excited to announce the launch of a protoype of **TATOE** - The Art Trail Organiser For Exhibitors.

<h2 class="acronym-highlight">Why TATOE?</h2>

As a retired software engineer and artist, I created TATOE to solve the problems I observed in local art trails. Traditional methods often rely on:
- Spreadsheets that become unwieldy
- Email chains that get lost
- Manual coordination that's time-consuming
- Limited visibility into the overall process

TATOE streamlines all of this into an intuitive, web-based system that works on any device.

<h2 class="acronym-highlight">Key Features</h2>

<h3 class="acronym-highlight">ðŸŽ¯ **Simple Setup**</h3>
- Create an art trail project in minutes
- Import participants with a single CSV upload

<h3 class="acronym-highlight">ðŸ“Š **Real-time Visibility**</h3>
- Live dashboard showing current status
- Track pending invitations and assignments
- Monitor venue capacity and availability

<h3 class="acronym-highlight">ðŸ”„ **Flexible Workflow**</h3>
- Participants can become venue leads
- Dynamic invitation and acceptance system
- Fluid assignments until deadline lock

<h3 class="acronym-highlight">ðŸ“± **Mobile-Friendly**</h3>
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Touch-optimized interfaces
- Offline-capable core features


<h2 class="acronym-highlight">Looking Forward</h2>

There are bound to be features I've missed. I'm actively seeking feedback from art trail organisers and participants to improve TATOE. Some planned features include:


<h2 class="acronym-highlight">Get Involved</h2>

I'm looking for **guinea pigs** to test TATOE! If you're organising an art trail or participating in one, please let me know. 

**Contact me** through the form on the home page.
